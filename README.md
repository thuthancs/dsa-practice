# Coding Interview - Data Structures & Algorithms Patterns
This repo consists of my own categorization of coding interview questions. I collected these questions from multiple sources, primarily Leetcode and books like Elements of Programming Interviews, Cracking the Coding Interview, and Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. I like to group the questions under a large theme and break it down further into data structures and common techniques.
